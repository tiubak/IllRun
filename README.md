# IllRun
This project is used as example of use of statsmodels sklean on supervised learning to conclude the for-credit option for **Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning** (CSCA 5622-100)

The main idea is create a model and an application that will predict if I'll be running tomorrow or not. It wil use a cleaned version of [RungGap](https://www.rungap.com/) csv file from my runnings on last year.

This notebook was created with unlimited help of search on the web (**google** engine) and **Gemini Pro 2.5** to answer specific questions about programming and how to use the libraries.

A demo of the project is running here:
